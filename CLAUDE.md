# Agent contract — Whisper quantization WER degradation curve

This repository is a **SOTA concept project** (`C-003`, archetype `implementation`).
It answers exactly one question:

> What INT quantization level produces the first statistically significant WER degradation in Whisper vs FP16 on clean speech?

## Before doing anything

Use the `/sota` skill — it wraps this. Manually:

```bash
FW=${SOTA_FRAMEWORK:-../sota-theoretical-framework}
python3 $FW/tools/sota.py next .
```

`next` prints the current phase, the first failing gate, the **exact files to read for this
phase**, and the commands to run when the work is done. Read only what it names — loading the
whole framework wastes the context you need for the work. Do not skip ahead to a later phase.

If the framework repository is not available locally, clone it — this project's gates cannot be
evaluated without it:
`git clone https://github.com/yoarajota/sota-theoretical-framework ../sota-theoretical-framework`

## Rules that bind you here

The full set is `framework/20-rules.md`. The ones violated most often:

- **No unevidenced claim.** Every capability, number, or comparison in `README.md` or `docs/`
  carries an `E-###` that resolves to an entry with a reproduction command, an environment, and
  an observed result. Adjectives without an ID get deleted, not softened.
- **No hand-written scores.** `composite_srl`, `translated_srl`, and component SRL values are
  written only by `sota.py srl --write`.
- **Readiness is descriptive.** Claim the highest level whose evidence reproduces *today*. If
  something broke, lower the level and say so.
- **Baseline or nothing.** "Faster" requires the named baseline, the metric, the conditions, and
  the `E-###`.
- **Complexity must be purchased.** Anything structural traces to a scenario `S-###` in
  `.sota/quality-gates.yaml` and is recorded in `complexity_ledger`. Otherwise remove it.
- **One question.** A second interesting idea goes to the framework's `registry/backlog.md`,
  not into this repository.
- **Real citations only.** Sources must have been fetched and read, not recalled.

## Definition of done for any change

```bash
python3 <framework>/tools/sota.py validate .            # gates + rules, must exit 0
python3 <framework>/tools/sota.py srl . --write         # if components/TRL/IRL changed
python3 <framework>/tools/sota.py scorecard . --write   # refresh the README block
<the iso5055 runner from .sota/quality-gates.yaml>      # must exit 0
```

**Advance phases on your own.** When `validate` exits 0 for the current phase, set the next
`phase:` and continue — do not ask permission. The gate is the checkpoint. Stop only for a
failed gate needing a human decision, a genuine fork, an outward-facing action, or scope the
human limited (`framework/10-lifecycle.md § Advancing between phases`).

**Before you run low on context**, append an `L-###` entry to `docs/03-log.md` with
`Disposition: open` describing what is half-finished. `sota.py next` prints it to the next
session. This is the only state that survives a session boundary.

Report: what changed, which gate state moved, and whether any readiness level went **down**.
A dropped level is a normal outcome and is stated plainly, never hidden.
